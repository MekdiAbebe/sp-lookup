# SharePoont Lookup Selector

A control that can be used with any form or without a form to Select List Items. Best used with SharePoint Custom Forms (New or Edit)

## Dependencies
I am using bootstrap 4.*.* CSS only for this version but will be including a custom built css to override the default style in the next release

## How to use

This is a react Component that needs to be installed first and used with any SPFx react projects as follows

To Install the component
- `npm i sp-lookup`

Usage
```react
<SPLookup label="Your Name" onChange={e=>console.log(e)}/>
```

You can freely download the code and extend on your own
